 * WickeXt plugins are components generating JavaScript jQuery code. WickeXt
 * hosts the component, outputs the JavaScript needed to function and imports
 * all JavaScript resources needed by the component.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To create a WickeXt plugin, you must implements the two methods below:
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link #getHeaderContribution()} is used to declare the resources needed
 * for the component. </li>
 * <li> {@link #statement()} returns the {@link JsStatement} used by the
 * component to function. </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A WickeXt plugin is automatically managed by the
 * {@link WickextPluginInstantiationListener}
